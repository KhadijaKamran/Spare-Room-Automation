Running Costs
Running costs are directly related to how many people are using the system, as 
we will have to use more resources with more data and more users.
1. For very few people using the system (1-1,000), cloud server charges will 
be approximately 6$ monthly.
2. If we scale it up and number of users increase, more cloud server 
resources will be required. For medium number of users (1,000-50,000)
It will be approximately 35$.
3. For a much more users (50,000 – 500,000), it can go up to 160$ per 
month.
These costs are estimates, they can vary depending upon how good a server 
we acquire and which cloud service we choose.
Queries
Everyone who has advertised rooms to rent on Spareroom is a 
potential customer in the future. It is possible to message these 
people on Spareroom, by Whatsapp, email and Facebook 
messenger although it does not reveal their details. Is it 
possible to scrap any of their information and target them on 
social media with sponsored ads?
I have tried to look up their information on SpareRoom, and I think we may not 
be able to directly find their contact information as SpareRoom does not reveal 
this information. 
What will be included
Following will be included in the project.
1. A website portal (with admin panels look & feel) having following pages.
a. A login page
b. A signup page (if required)
c. A dashboard webpage showing analytics which include the ratio of 
rooms on rent with people looking for rooms, and the analytics of 
best time for traffic and engagement with prospects.
d. A webpage for the complete settings of messages sent to new 
tenants and the follow-up messages. The page will also include to 
set time for `renew`. Default time will be an hour.
e. A webpage to add SpareRoom Accounts into the system.
f. A webpage for admin which will have an option to create and 
update other user accounts on the system.
2. Scripts will be created to scrap all the required data from SpareRoom for 
each user. These scripts will run for each user on the system and keep 
the data updated.
3. A database will be designed where all the scraped data will be stored. 
The internal data of the system will also be stored there.
4. A cloud server will be set up. Scripts and the database will be placed and 
run on the server to ensure performance, and reliability of the system. 
The cost estimates for server are included in the section of ‘Running 
Costs’ above
